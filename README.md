# Go Data Structures 
> ## **v1.0**

## Basic data structures implemented on Go.

**This repo exists for studying purposes**. The data structures work normally but some may not be implemented in the most optimal way.

### Moving Forward :

The data structures have been implemented using the type ```int``` as their entries. According to the post ["A Proposal for Adding Generics to Go"](https://go.dev/blog/generics-proposal), go generics will be added in the Go 1.18 betas. If generics get added in a future stable version of Go I will be updating these data structures to be used with generic types.

I also plan to add Graphs to this package in the future.
